		<h2>Northside Special</h2>
		<h3>General tao's chicken with jasmine rice and green beans</h3>
		<p>
			First off the green beans. They weren't too crunchy and they fell more towards the mushy side. Most likely to 
			have been because it sat around for a while.		
		</p>
		<p>
			Next was the chicken. Precooked in its entirety. overall it was a sub-par gum flavour, as it was quite chewy.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Rice by itself was a bit bland, which is to be expected with plain white rice. However, mixed with the chicken
		the combined textures was very pleasing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Last but certainly not least was the sauce. A mixture of tangy sweet and sour complimented by the red pepper gives it a nice kick.
		
		</p>
		<p>
		Overall this dish receives 3.5 Rainbows
		</p>

		<h2>Northside Pizza</h2>
		<h3>Meatlover's Special<h3>
		<p>
			This pizza should have been confiscated by BP because this pizza had an excruciating amount of oil on it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The individual meats were of lesser quality as to be expected from sodexo.	First off is the sausage: It was flavourful enough, but upon closer inspection
			had chunks of fat. The peperoni was very crispy and acceptable. The ham seemed to have been sliced thinly off of a ham steak of decent quality. Lastly was the bacon.
			I didn't even realize there was bacon at first, I just thought they had burned part of the pizza. They would have better off laying the bacon under the cheese to preserve
			its flavour. There also was a sub-par sprinkling of spices on the pizza after it had cooked. It would have been loads better if they had sprinkled it on before they cooked. 
			That way the flavours would have time to extend its reach
		
		</p>
		<p>
		Overall the oily mess of a pizza gets 2.0 Rainbows

		<h2>Northside Dessert</h2>
		<h3>Turtle Brownie from Redstone bakery</h3>
		<p>
			This thing is really god damn chewy. It doesn't even deserve to be called a brownie. More like chocolate flavoured chewing gum.
		</p>
		<p>
			Still it's a brownie, 3.0 Rainbows
