 <h2> The Grundle Special</h2>
    <h3>Glazed Pollock Marinated in a Seafood BBQ Sauce</h3>

      <p>Wow. Just wow. This was just a disaster. I only subjected myself to one
      measly bite of this fishy atrocity, and it was still brutal. That fish must
      have been sitting there for weeks. It was tangy, dry, and relentless. Avoid
      this dish at all costs. I could not justify giving this fish any amount of
      rainbows.</p>
                <p>
		NO RAINBOWS FOR YOU.

      <h2>The Grundle Pizza</h2>
        <h3>Pepperoni Pizza</h3>
		<img class="pic"  src="pics/adrian-pizza.jpg" alt="" height="40" width="50">
      <p>This pepperoni pizza was by far the worst I've had on campus. It was 
      wayyyyy to chewy; it's texture was similar to that of a rubber band soaked
      in gasoline. I would hope that no one ever subjects themselves to a 
      sub-par slice. </p>

		<h2>The Grundle Dessert</h2>
		<h3>Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Icing</h3>
<img class="pic"  src="pics/chocolate-cake.jpg" alt="" height="40" width="50">
 <p>This cake was quite delicious. The cake itself was very spongy and light while
 the vanilla frosting overpowered much of the chocolate. It was pure sugar
 ecstacy and I would recommend it to anyone with a love of sweets.</p>
		
 <p>
			Totally solid 4.0/5 Rainbows
